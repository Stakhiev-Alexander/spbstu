Tasks for my course work on the discipline "Computer Architecture":

  1)To develop a procedure for merging two ordered lists of the form "SURNAME N.P.(first letters of name and patronymic)" with preservation of the alphabetical order. Display original and final lists.

  2)Replace the Del key with CapsLock key. Write a program to process keyboard interrupts that replaces scan-codes of keys. Each time you press a key, beep using the 3rd channel timer.
